# CannaVille Pro - Development Plan

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Research and Asset Sourcing
- [x] Analyze reference images for visual quality and environment details
- [x] Review provided GLB models for suitability and identify any gaps
- [ ] Research and source additional hyper-realistic 3D models (plants, environment props, avatars) if needed
- [ ] Research best practices for mobile game development (Android/iOS) and performance optimization for 3D graphics
- [ ] Research best practices for secure user authentication and database design
- [ ] Research Stripe integration for in-app purchases and subscriptions

## Phase 2: Backend Development: API, Database, and Stripe Integration
- [x] Set up secure Flask backend with user authentication
- [x] Design and implement user database schema

- [x] Implement robust security measures for data protection

## Phase 3: Frontend Development: Hyper-Realistic 3D Environment and UI
- [x] Set up Three.js project for 3D rendering
- [x] Implement immersive 3D environments (indoor DWC, outdoor grid) based on reference images
- [x] Integrate and optimize hyper-realistic GLB plant models with growth stages and rotation
- [x] Implement first-person avatar movement and interaction with plants/environment
- [x] Design and implement a functional and intuitive UI/UX based on user feedback
- [ ] Develop AI texture generation integration (if applicable)

## Phase 4: Integration and Local Testing
