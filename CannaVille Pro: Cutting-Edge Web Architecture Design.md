Our solution combines WebGL 2.0 rendering pipelines, advanced shader programming, progressive web application technologies, and modern JavaScript frameworks to create an unprecedented web-based gaming experience.

## Technical Vision and Quality Targets

### Visual Quality Benchmarks

Based on the provided reference images, CannaVille Pro must achieve visual fidelity comparable to high-end mobile games such as those shown in the isometric cannabis growing simulator references. The target visual quality includes photorealistic plant models with detailed leaf structures, realistic lighting and shadow systems, high-resolution textures with normal mapping, and smooth animation systems for plant growth and environmental effects.

The application must support two distinct environmental modes: an indoor Deep Water Culture (DWC) hydroponic system featuring six recirculating buckets within a 4×4 foot grow tent, and an outdoor cultivation area with a 5×5 grid of hand-dug planting holes. Each environment requires meticulous attention to detail, including accurate equipment modeling, realistic material properties, and dynamic lighting systems that respond to user interactions and environmental changes.

### Performance Requirements

The architecture targets 60 FPS performance on desktop systems and 30 FPS on mobile devices, with adaptive quality scaling to maintain smooth gameplay across a wide range of hardware configurations. Memory usage must remain below 512MB on mobile devices, with efficient asset streaming and garbage collection to prevent performance degradation during extended play sessions.

Loading times are critical for user retention, with initial application load targeting under 5 seconds on 4G connections and subsequent scene transitions completing within 2 seconds. Progressive loading strategies ensure users can begin interacting with the application while additional assets load in the background.



## Core Technology Stack

### Frontend Rendering Engine

**Three.js with WebGL 2.0** forms the foundation of our 3D rendering pipeline, providing access to advanced GPU features including instanced rendering, transform feedback, and compute shaders. The choice of Three.js over lower-level WebGL programming enables rapid development while maintaining the flexibility to implement custom shaders and rendering techniques.

**Custom Shader Pipeline** leverages GLSL ES 3.0 to implement physically-based rendering (PBR) materials, advanced lighting models, and post-processing effects. Our shader architecture includes support for normal mapping, parallax occlusion mapping, subsurface scattering for realistic plant materials, and dynamic environment mapping for reflective surfaces.

**WebAssembly (WASM) Integration** accelerates computationally intensive operations including physics simulations, AI pathfinding, and complex mathematical calculations. Critical performance bottlenecks are identified and migrated to WASM modules compiled from C++ or Rust, providing near-native performance for demanding algorithms.

### Advanced Rendering Features

**Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)** ensures materials respond realistically to lighting conditions, with support for metallic/roughness workflows, albedo textures, and environment-based lighting. Plant materials utilize specialized shaders that simulate subsurface scattering and translucency effects, creating convincing organic appearances.

**Real-Time Global Illumination** approximates advanced lighting techniques through screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), screen-space reflections (SSR), and light probe interpolation. While not achieving the quality of hardware ray tracing, these techniques provide significant visual improvements over basic lighting models.

**Dynamic Shadow Mapping** implements cascaded shadow maps for directional lighting and variance shadow maps for soft shadows. Shadow quality adapts based on device capabilities, with high-end devices receiving 4K shadow maps and mobile devices utilizing optimized 1K maps with percentage-closer filtering.

**Post-Processing Pipeline** includes tone mapping, color grading, bloom effects, depth of field, and temporal anti-aliasing (TAA). The pipeline is modular, allowing effects to be enabled or disabled based on performance requirements and user preferences.
