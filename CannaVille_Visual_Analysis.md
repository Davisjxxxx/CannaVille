## Reference Image Analysis

### Image 1 (1000044033.jpg / 1000044032.jpg) - Indoor Grow Room
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Isometric view, highly detailed environment with various props (shelves, tools, buckets, bathtub, tires, etc.).
- **Lighting**: Appears to be natural light coming from windows, with some internal light sources. Good use of shadows and ambient occlusion to create depth.
- **Plant Detail**: The cannabis plant in the center, while not hyper-realistic, shows distinct leaves and a general plant structure. The user explicitly stated this is the 'bare minimum' and desires the quality of the purple cannabis image.
- **Environment Details**: Brick walls, wooden shelves, concrete floor, various clutter. Suggests a lived-in, realistic space.
- **UI/UX**: Character speaking bubble, clear indication of interaction (orange arrow). This implies a need for interactive elements and clear visual cues for user actions.

### Image 2 (1000044039.jpg) - Outdoor Grid of Holes
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Top-down view of a 5x5 grid of hand-dug holes in grass.
- **Realism**: The grass texture is realistic, with variations in color and height. The soil around the holes looks natural and disturbed.
- **Plant Detail**: Small seedlings are visible in some holes, indicating early growth stages.
- **Geometry**: The holes are not perfectly circular, suggesting a natural, hand-dug appearance, which aligns with the previous asset brief.

### Image 3 (1000044038.jpg) - Indoor DWC Setup (Real Photo)
- **Overall Aesthetic**: Real-world photograph of a DWC setup inside a grow tent.
- **Hyper-Realism Target**: This image sets the bar for the desired level of realism for the DWC system. Details like the reflective mylar walls, PVC piping, bucket textures, and LED lights are crucial.
- **Lighting**: Intense grow lights, casting realistic shadows and reflections on the mylar.
- **Equipment Detail**: Shows the complexity of the DWC system, including pumps, manifolds, and tubing. This requires accurate 3D modeling of these components.

### Image 4 (1000044040.jpg) - Hyper-Realistic Purple Cannabis Bud
- **Key Visual Target**: This image represents the *absolute minimum* quality expected for the cannabis plants themselves. It shows:
    - **Extreme Detail**: Visible trichomes, intricate bud structure, realistic leaf venation.
    - **Material Quality**: Subsurface scattering, realistic reflections, and absorption properties.
    - **Lighting**: Professional studio lighting, highlighting the plant's textures and forms.
- **Color**: The vibrant purple color indicates the need for accurate material and texture application.

## Summary of Visual Quality Expectations:
- **Environments**: Highly detailed, realistic, and immersive, matching the reference photos for both indoor and outdoor scenes.
- **Plants**: Hyper-realistic, with intricate details, accurate material properties, and visual representation of all growth stages, targeting the quality of the purple cannabis bud image.
- **Lighting**: Realistic lighting that enhances the 3D models and creates a believable atmosphere.
- **Interactivity**: Clear visual cues for interaction and a sense of being able to
